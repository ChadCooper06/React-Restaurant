React Restaurant App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a responsive multi-page app allowing users to see the menu and specials for a created restaurant after being on a landing page. Contact information and location are visible and all menu items are retrieved via an Axios call to an API containing various dishes under multiple cuisines.

Created using React, Axios, local storage (to hold the returned information from API limiting further calls) and CSS3.
